## üé® Design System & Patterns

- **Glassmorphism:**  
  Cards and modals use `backdrop-blur`, semi-transparent backgrounds, and layered box-shadows.  
  Example: The `ThreeDCard` component wraps all main content for a glassy, 3D look.

- **3D Cards & Animated Effects:**  
  Cards, buttons, and toggles have depth, glowing borders, and hover ‚Äúlift‚Äù using Framer Motion.  
  Sidebar and menu button use 3D transforms and animated glows.

- **Animated Aurora Background:**  
  The background is a full-page, animated gradient (using Framer Motion) that cycles through aurora/rainbow colors.  
  Easily customizable in `App.jsx`.

- **Mobile-First & Responsive:**  
  Uses Tailwind‚Äôs responsive classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) for all layouts, paddings, and font sizes.  
  Sidebar collapses and resizes for mobile; cards and buttons become full-width and stack vertically.

- **Accessibility:**  
  All interactive elements have focus rings, ARIA labels, and sufficient color contrast.  
  Touch targets are large and easy to use on mobile.

- **Utility Classes & Custom Components:**  
  Tailwind utility classes for rapid, consistent styling.  
  Custom components (e.g., `ThreeDCard`, `AnimatedThemeToggle`) encapsulate design patterns.

## üß© Component Architecture

### Key Reusable Components
- **Sidebar:**  Responsive, animated, collapsible navigation with 3D menu button and route highlighting.
- **Header:**  Top bar with page title and animated theme toggle.
- **ThreeDCard:**  Universal glassmorphism card for wrapping tables, charts, and settings. Handles 3D effects, blur, and shadows.
- **AnimatedThemeToggle:**  Beautiful, animated toggle for dark/light mode with 3D and glowing effects.
- **StatCard, SettingSection, ToggleSwitch:**  Modular, reusable UI blocks for stats, settings, and toggles.

### Creating New Cards/Pages
- Wrap new content in `<ThreeDCard>...</ThreeDCard>` for instant 3D glassy effect.
- Use Tailwind‚Äôs responsive classes for layout and spacing.
- Add new routes in the `SIDEBAR_ITEMS` array and create a corresponding page in `/pages`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization & Extensibility

- **Add New Routes:**  Edit `SIDEBAR_ITEMS` in `Sidebar.jsx` and add a new page in `/pages`.
- **Add New Cards/Charts:**  Create a new component, wrap it in `ThreeDCard`, and import it into the desired page.
- **Change Color Palette/Gradients:**  Edit Tailwind config or the gradient arrays in `App.jsx` for backgrounds and cards.
- **Adjust Animation Speed:**  Change the `duration` or `stiffness` in Framer Motion transitions (e.g., sidebar, cards).
- **Add Settings/Sections:**  Create a new component in `/components/settings/`, wrap in `ThreeDCard`, and add to `SettingsPage.jsx`.

---

## üì± Responsive & Accessibility Details

- **Layout:**  
  - Uses `flex`, `grid`, and responsive classes for all layouts.  
  - Sidebar resizes and collapses for mobile.  
  - Cards and buttons become full-width and stack vertically on small screens.

- **Touch & Keyboard:**  
  - All buttons and toggles are large enough for touch.  
  - Keyboard navigation and focus rings are enabled.

- **ARIA & Contrast:**  
  - ARIA labels on toggles, buttons, and navigation.  
  - Color palette ensures sufficient contrast in both light and dark modes.

## ‚ö° Performance & Best Practices

- **Vite:**  Fast HMR, instant reloads, and optimized production builds.
- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:**  Only loads what‚Äôs needed for each page.
- **Bundle Optimization:**  Uses modern JS, tree-shaking, and optimized dependencies.
- **Linting & Formatting:**  ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency.
